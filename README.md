# Diffusion Model from scratch with PyTorch

```python diffusion_model.py```


This will train the diffusion model for a specified number of epochs on the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Model Architecture
The diffusion model architecture consists of a UNet-based generator with convolutional and upsampling layers. The model utilizes conditional embeddings and diffusion steps for noise prediction.

## Dataset
The FashionMNIST dataset is used for training and evaluation. It consists of grayscale images of various fashion items such as t-shirts, pants, dresses, etc.

## Evaluation
After training, you can evaluate the trained model using the provided fashion_encoder function to generate conditional embeddings for specific fashion items. Additionally, you can generate sample images using random noise inputs.

## Results
Sample images generated by the trained model are visualized and saved for qualitative evaluation.
